Elokenz is still in *private beta* phase. You cannot register a new account if you don't have an invitation. 

## How to get an invitation
If you want to get an invitation, sign up on [our homepage](http://www.elokenz.com). We slowly release invites, very slowly.

If you really want to get an invitation, just ping [Fanny](https://twitter.com/FannyOnHolidays) and she will see if you can fit in the coming testing cohort.
