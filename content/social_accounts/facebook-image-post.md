Title: How to post as an image on Facebook?
*/


When you create a Repost for Facebook, it can be posted in two distinct ways: as an image and as a link. When you post as an image, it's called an `image-post publication`.

Note that you can also [repost as links on Facebook](/social_accounts/facebook-link-post). **Posting as an image is often a better way to increase your reach** since Facebook is giving more weight to images than links.

To post on Facebook as an image, you need to create a [variation](/getting-started/definitions#repost-variation) that has an attached picture. Here is an example :

<img src="/images/social_accounts/repost_facebook_message_as_picture_post.png" alt="Elokenz - Repost on Facebook as an image with link"><center><i>Elokenz - Repost on Facebook as an image with link <br />(see the post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/664990440241366_1899180216822376
" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>)</i></center><br />
