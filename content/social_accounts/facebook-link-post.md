Title: How to post as a link on Facebook?
*/


When you create a Repost for Facebook, it can be posted in two distinct ways: as an image and as a link. When you post as a link, it's called a `link-post publication`.

Note that you can also [repost as images on Facebook](/social_accounts/facebook-image-post). **Posting as an image is often a better way to increase your reach** since Facebook is giving more weight to images than links. However, if you are sure that you want to post as a link, keep reading.

To post on Facebook as a link, you need to create a [variation](/getting-started/definitions#repost-variation) that has no attached picture. Here is an example :

<img src="/images/social_accounts/repost_on_facebook_as_link_post.png" alt="Elokenz - Repost on Facebook as a link"><center><i>Elokenz - Repost on Facebook as a link <br />(see the post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elokenz/posts/1900108263396238
" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>)</i></center><br />


## How is the preview image rendered on Facebook?
When you publish a link-post, you might often see an image that comes with a summary of your article (you can see that in the previous image).

The preview image (and the summary text) is extracted from the shared page HTML. You can change it by using the correct OG Tags on your site.

## Can I change the rendered image from Elokenz?

Elokenz cannot change the image that is used as a preview.

It was possible in the past, but after the "fake news" tornado that hit Facebook in Summer 2017, they started to forbid the edition of the preview picture and summary text (see the [official press release](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2017/06/27/API-Change-Log-Modifying-Link-Previews/)).
