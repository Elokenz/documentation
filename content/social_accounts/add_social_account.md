### Give Elokenz publishing permissions

A permission popup from the social network you are trying to connect will appear. To proceed, you need to give Elokenz the permission to post on your behalf. Without that, Elokenz will not be able to post for you.

If you are connecting a Twitter account, this step will be the final one. If you are connecting Linkedin or Facebook, read on:

### Select the profile you want to add

On Facebook and Linkedin, Elokenz can manage your personal profiles, but also pages or groups. After giving your permissions to Elokenz, you will be redirected to the dashboard. All profiles that you can manage from your personal account will be listed.

To proceed, you need to click on "Add this account" for the profile you want to connect to Elokenz.
