Title: About reposts
*/

Repost by Elokenz is a tool for social media. It helps you to **repost your most resonating content to social media**.

## Usage
A repost is linked to an [article](/usage/adding-articles).

To create a repost, open the [Reposts](http://dashboard.elokenz.com/#/repost) page.
Click on the button `Add a Repost`. 

A popup will appear with the articles you can repost. Click on the twitter icon and you will be redirected to a setting page for the newly created repost.

On this page, you need to adjust the _settings_ and add some _messages_.

## Available settings
A repost has few settings. Here is the list and the explaination :

* _Evergreen_ / _Regular_ : Regular articles expires by themselves after a while. Instead evergreen articles will keep being reshared for a long time.
* _Expiration_ : If a given article has to expire on a given date, use this setting. Example : a repost for _the top xxx tips for 2016_ , should not be shared after December 31st 2016.
* Boost : You can artificially boost a given article if you want to see it reposted more often. Conversly, if you want to see it less often, just decrease the boost.


## Adding messages
A **message** is a content that will be shared on social networks. When reposting a message, Elokenz will randomly pick among your available message to emit on social networks. By doing this, you can try several variations and see which one converts better.

Click on the `Add a message` button. A new form will appear. Type your message in the form and finally hit `Add this message`. Inside your message you can add various variables :

* {{url}} (**required**) : this variable will be replaced by the url of the article
* {{image}} : _not implemented yet_
