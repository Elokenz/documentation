Title: About reposts
*/

Repost by Elokenz is a tool for social media. It helps you to **repost your most resonating content to social media**.

## Usage
A repost is linked to an [article](/general-usage/adding-articles).

To create a repost, open the [Repost](https://app.elokenz.com/#/repost) page.
Click on the button `Add a Repost`.

A popup will appear with the articles you can repost. If the article is not in your Library, you can enter an URL. Click `Add URL`: the article will be imported and you will be redirected to the Repost edition page.

On this page, you need to adjust the _settings_ and add some post variations.

## Available settings
A repost has few settings. Here is the list and the explaination :

* _Repost Type_ (_Evergreen_ / _News_) : News articles expires by themselves after a while. Instead evergreen articles will keep being reshared for a long time.
* _Expiration_ : If a given article has to expire on a given date, use this setting. Example: a repost for _the top xxx tips for 2016_, should not be shared after December 31st 2016.

<!--Boost : You can artificially boost a given article if you want to see it reposted more often. Conversly, if you want to see it less often, just decrease the boost.-->


## Adding messages
A **message** is a content that will be shared on social networks. When reposting a message, Elokenz will randomly pick among your available message to emit on social networks. By doing this, you can try several variations and see which one converts better.

Click on the `Add a message` button. A new form will appear. Type your message in the form and finally hit `Add this message`. Inside your message you can add various variables :

* {{url}} (**required**) : this variable will be replaced by the url of the article
