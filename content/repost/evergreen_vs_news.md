Title: Evergreen VS News articles
*/

On Repost you can define your articles in to different ways : **news** or **evergreen**. This setting is related to the lifetime of your content.
Changing the type will change the _frequency_ at which your article is reposted and the _time before it becomes expired_.

## Evergreen Article
An evergreen article is an article with a very long lifetime. It could be, for instance, a post describing a city, an explaination about a sport or a biography. For all those posts, the value will be the same over the years.

In Repost, an evergreen article will be frequently shared and the [repost energy](/repost/repost-energy) will continuously grow.

## News Article
The lifetime is limited which means that after a while, if a piece of content doesn't bring clicks or social mentions, we might strongly reduce the *sharing frequency*. The energy required to be reposted will be strongly damped, which means that the time between two reposts will get very long.

## Sharing Frequency
The lowest sharing frequency is defined for each social profile in your settings, with a slider named *content fatigue*.

When you define a *content fatigue* duration of 2 months, it means that a evergreen post that receive no interest (visits or reshares) will only be reposted every 2 months.

This settings is specific to each individual social account, so, to change it, follow the following steps:
