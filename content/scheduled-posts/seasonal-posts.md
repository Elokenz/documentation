Title: Can I publish Reposts depending on the season?

Many users are wondering if Elokenz can be configured to prevent articles about Winter to be posted in Summer and reciprocally.

Unfortunately **it is not possible at the moment**.

To prevent your posts to be posted during the wrong season, you need to log into Elokenz once in a while, and check the scheduled Reposts for the coming days. If one post should not be posted, you can set a different time to change the date of emission.
