Creating your first Repost is pretty easy. You first need to log onto [Elokenz](https://app.elokenz.com) app

## Online Tour
If it is the first time you login, an **online tutorial** will appear, and you will be guided along the most important steps.

Follow the steps and you should have your first Repost correctly setup.
If you missed the tour or skipped it, read along and you will find basic steps.

## 1 - Connect a social network
Before reposting your content on your social networks you need to connect at least one social network to your account. To do that, go to the [Repost](https://app.elokenz.com/#/repost) tab. If you have no account connected, you will see a message telling you that you need to connect your first social account: pick the social network that you want to connect, and click the button.

If you already have social account but want to add another, you will find a "Connect more accounts" button in the left menu.

## 2 - Add content to your library
First, you need to add content to your library. Here we are referring to blog posts, videos, podcasts, ... any kind of content you have created or that you want to promote.

Go to your [Library](https://app.elokenz.com/#/articles) and insert your URL into the form, then press "Add URL".

Your article will be imported to Elokenz, and the app will extract required information (title, images, meta description). Once it's done, you will be automatically redirected to the Repost edition page.
