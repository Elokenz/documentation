Creating your first Repost is pretty easy. You first need to log onto [Elokenz](https://app.elokenz.com) app

## Online Tour
If it is the first time you login, an **online tutorial** will appear, and you will be guided along the most important steps.

Follow the steps and you should have your first Repost correctly setup.
If you missed the tour or skipped it, read along and you will find basic steps.

## 1 - Connect a social network
Before reposting your content on your social networks you need to connect at least one social network to your account. To do that, go to the [Repost](https://app.elokenz.com/#/repost) tab. If you have no account connected, you will see a message telling you that you need to connect your first social account: pick the social network that you want to connect, and click the button.

If you already have social account but want to add another, you will find a "Connect more accounts" button in the left menu.

## 2 - Add content to your library
First, you need to add content to your library. Here we are referring to blog posts, videos, podcasts, ... any kind of content you have created or that you want to promote.

Go to your [Library](https://app.elokenz.com/#/articles) and insert your URL into the form, then press "Add URL".

Your article will be imported to Elokenz, and the app will extract required information (title, images, meta description). Once it's done, you will be automatically redirected to the Repost edition page.

It can happen that your page is not correcty imported. You can refer to the article "[Why my content is not correctly imported](/troubleshoot/title_not_imported)" if that happens to you.


## 3 - Edit your Repost variations
Once you are on the main edition window, you need first to make sure that the social network you want to use is selected, then type your message in the form. Finally, press "Add Message" to save the Repost variation. You can use several variations and Elokenz will rotate time after time and use the most efficient more frequently.

## 4 - Check that everything is good

In theory your Repost should now be well configured and ready for the next slot of publication. However, if you missed one step, a red radio button will warn you that something is not correct.

The system will tell you that everything is good and ready when the top left radio button becomes green. You can return to the previous screen by clicking the "I'm done editing this post".
