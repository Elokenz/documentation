Here we defined the various terms we will be using throughout this documentation. Most terms are self-explanatory:


### Article
An article is a piece of content. We sometime write "Article" when we mean any type of content in your library (might be videos or podcast).
We know it's confusing, but most of the times, people use Elokenz to repost blog posts or news articles that we got this habit.

### Calendar

In Elokenz you have to create an editorial **calendar** to specify when you want the tool to post for you on each social networks. A calendar has several Posting Slots.

### Content
In Elokenz, a piece of content can be understood as a anything that has been published online, and that is accessible via an URL.
You can track and repost several content types on Elokenz:

* Articles (blog posts, news articles)
* Web pages
* Videos
* Audio (Music, Podcast)

We might sometimes use the word **article** instead of **content** in the documentation. It will however carry the same meaning.

### Dashboard
The homepage from our app. Here you will find a summary of recent **Reposts** and the latests analytics related.

### Library
The list of your **content**. A content item is identified by its unique URL. There is a limit of content items you can add to your library. This limit is related to your subscription plan.

### Link
Everytime a piece of content is shared, the Repost Status will contain a text message together with a link to your content. This link is minified (shortened), this allows us to track clicks and traffic for each Repost Variation.

### Posted Message
When Elokenz reposts one of your variation on your social networks, it is then called a Posted Message.


### Posting Slot
A posting slot is defined by a week day and a time (eg. "Friday - 9:45" or "Tuesday - 16:15"). It is used in your **Calendar**.

### Repost
A **Repost** is an umbrella term that stands for "a content that is going to be reposted over time by Elokenz". To avoid confusion with the verb (*to repost*), when we refer to a content in the app, we will capitalize the word: Repost.

### Repost Message
Same as Repost Variation

### Repost Status
A Repost Status can either be:

* the same as a Repost Variation
* the same as a Posted Message

We will try to specify each time we use this term.

### Repost Variation
When you are creating a Repost, you will be able to specify several possible **posts** that will be shared on social networks. We call each post a **Repost Variation**, but most often we simply use **Repost Message** instead.

Elokenz mindset is to prevent **social fatigue** among your followers. This explains why we suggest you to create several variations for a given piece of reposted content.


### Social Account
A **social account** is an account that you can manage on a third-party network (Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin). Prior posting Reposts on one social account, you need to authorize Elokenz to do it (see dedicated section {TODO})

### Social Fatigue
Social Fatigue is what happens when you post too frequently on social networks, and that your posts are not interestng for your audience. By definition, Elokenz Repost might create some social fatigue among your followers. This is why we have decided to limit this to the maximum by :

* suggesting you to create several Repost Messages
* limiting the delay between two consecutive publications of the same content


The latter is an **option** that you can tune independently for each social networks. You can find more explainations in the post {TODO}.

### Sources
A **Source** is an external website that we use to scan for new articles or content you might have published. Most of the time a source is an RSS Feed or a Sitemap (see dedicated section {{TODO}}).

### Suggested Content
On a daily basis, Elokenz scans your **Sources** and it will suggest new content automatically. You can then add each item to your library, or dismiss the suggestion.
